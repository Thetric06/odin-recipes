<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These fried Brussels sprouts are easy and most kids are actually surprised that they taste better than they look! Like fried cabbage? Then you are in for a treat with this recipe as well. I add about 2 tablespoons of sugar simply to soften the taste and make my kids happy. But it is delicious without the sugar, and when I leave it out, I don't tell them and they never say a word.</p>
